# Week 4 Review (Jan 20-26, 2026)

**Reviewed:** 2026-01-25
**Energy this week:** 5-6/10 (sick)
**Overall:** Good — strong infrastructure progress despite low energy

---

## Wins

- ClawdBot infrastructure up and running (Mac Mini, integrations, two-way Slack)
- Chuck Vault major progress (focus system, skills, weekly review)
- Indie Crates CI/CD clean, auto-deploy working
- GetMusic.fm: Background release processing started, radio station track tool built
- Stayed productive while sick

## What Didn't Happen

- Chuck Vault on ClawdBot (in progress)
- LEA repos on ClawdBot
- GET-925 release notes
- Max follow-up (scheduled for Monday)

## Lessons

- Sick weeks are good for infrastructure/systems work (lower cognitive load)
- Building the systems now will pay dividends later
- Delegation theme emerging — need to set team up for success

## Area Check-In

### Work (LEA)
**Progress:** Light week due to sick. GET-925 still pending.

**Blockers:** None — just capacity.

**Next week focus:** Catch up on GET-925, Max follow-up, delegation setup for team.

### Ventures
**Progress:** Strong week. ClawdBot running, Indie Crates CI/CD clean, Chuck Vault restructured.

**Next week focus:** Finish ClawdBot setup — Chuck Vault + LEA repos.

### Personal
**Progress:** GLP-1 continuing, week 5 starts. Still recovering from sick.

**Next week focus:** Kai school stuff, ease back into routine.
