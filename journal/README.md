Daily reflections and entries. This is for YOU - be honest, be brief, be real.

## Structure

```

## Entry Template

```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD

**Energy:** /10
**Focus:** [What I'm focused on]

## Morning
- Intentions for the day
- Priorities

## Evening
- What happened
- Wins
- Lessons
- Tomorrow's priority
```

## Tips

- Keep it brief - this isn't a memoir
- Energy tracking reveals patterns over time
- Capture wins, even small ones
- Note what drained vs gave energy
- Be honest about what didn't happen
