## Notes

### Brenton Situation
Worked through some frustrations about working dynamic with Brenton. Key issues:
- PTO: 8 days used in 4 months (of 10/year)
- Communication: tendency to lecture about approach while I'm the one keeping things running
- Sidekiq incident: He expanded scope on migration Monday, then I found out he's OOO Thu-Mon. Reverted PR, will pick up next week.

Need to have direct conversations about PTO pacing and ownership. See `people/brenton-morris.md` for detailed notes on what to address.
