# 2026-01-22

**Energy:** 4/10
**Fires:** None
**Focus:** Light day - follow-ups, backlog grooming, planning

**Notes:**
- Working from home, feeling a bit sick
- Take-it-easy day, similar to yesterday
- Good day for planning and low-intensity work

---

## Priorities

1. **Farther outreach** — Let them know Reducto model update is coming for extraction issues
2. **Brenton sync** — Review document upload work + walk through Ignite system
3. **Backlog grooming / planning** — Next week prep, next activities

## Linear Focus

- GET-882: Farther BoA extraction (In Progress, Urgent)
- Backlog review / grooming

## Open Reminders

- David Lei: Upload eval documents to Linear issues (follow-up 2026-01-23)
- Max Klein: GET-921 rollout plan details (follow-up 2026-01-26)

## End of Day

**Energy:** 5/10 (slight improvement, productive despite being sick)

### Completed
- Brenton sync on document upload work + Ignite system walkthrough
- Backlog grooming and planning for next week
- Got brokerage statement sample to David for eval/model work
- AI/Claude workflow work

### Moved to Tomorrow
- Farther outreach — let them know Reducto model update coming for extraction issues

### Team Organization Notes (to revisit)
- **David**: Need to line up more structured work around models/evals. Challenge: still scoping some of it myself. Goal: get him on the rails.
- **Brenton**: Find efficient ways to align quickly so he can run autonomously. The unlock is faster sync → more independence.
- Theme: reducing myself as bottleneck on both fronts.

### Notes for Tomorrow
- Farther outreach first thing
- Continue light recovery day if still feeling off
