# Corrections Skill

Capture and learn from mistakes to avoid repeating them.

## When to Use

Whenever Chuck corrects me on something - whether it's a factual error, a wrong assumption, a misunderstanding of his preferences, or a process issue - capture it immediately.

## Process

1. **Acknowledge** the correction without over-apologizing
2. **Fix** the immediate issue if possible
3. **Log** the correction in `knowledge/claude-corrections.md`
4. **Update** any relevant skill or context file if the correction reveals a systemic issue

## What to Capture

Log entries should include:
- **Date** of the correction
- **Category** (Factual, Preference, Process, Assumption, Other)
- **What went wrong** - brief description of the error
- **Correction** - what Chuck said or what the right answer is
- **Fix applied** - what file/skill was updated, if any

## Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Factual | Wrong date, incorrect information |
| Preference | Tone, format, or style Chuck doesn't like |
| Process | Wrong workflow, skipped steps |
| Assumption | Assumed something without checking |
| Context | Missed relevant context I should have known |

## Reference

Before making assumptions in areas where I've been corrected before, check `knowledge/claude-corrections.md` for relevant past corrections.
