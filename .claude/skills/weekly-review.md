## The Review Process

### Phase 1: Get Clear (Collect & Process)

**Goal:** Empty all inboxes and capture systems to zero.

1. **Process inbox/**
   - Review each item in `inbox/`
   - For each: Delete, Do (if <2 min), Defer (add to appropriate list), Delegate, or File
   - Move processed items or delete

2. **Capture loose items**
   - Ask: "Anything floating in your head that needs capturing?"
   - Quick capture to appropriate location

3. **Review recent captures**
   - Scan journal entries from the week
   - Any items that need action?

---

### Phase 2: Get Current (Review Systems)

**Goal:** Review all active commitments and update status.

#### 2a. Review Last Week

Read `focus/2026/WXX.md` for the closing week:
- What got done? (Celebrate wins)
