## Section 1: The Problem

### Every todo app wants to be smart.

They sort your tasks. Suggest due dates. Auto-schedule your day. Integrate with 47 other apps.

And then your AI assistant can't read any of it.

Your tasks are locked in proprietary databases, hidden behind APIs, trapped in formats that look like this:

```json
{"id":"8f3a9b2c","title":"Call dentist","metadata":{"project_id":"health_2024","tags":[{"id":"t_3fa8"}]}}
```

Good luck getting Claude to do anything useful with that.

---

## Section 2: The Solution

### What if your todo list was just... a text file?

**MinisList** is aggressively simple:

- ✅ Add tasks
- ✅ Check them off
- ✅ That's it

No AI. No suggestions. No integrations. No "smart" anything.

Just markdown files that sync to your folder:

```markdown
# 2026-01-31

- [ ] Call dentist @Health #phone
- [ ] Review proposal @Work !high +Sarah
- [x] Buy coffee
```

Human-readable. AI-readable. Grep-able. Future-proof.

---

## Section 3: Why Dumb is Smart

### Your AI assistant can now:

- **Read your tasks** — It's just text
- **Process overnight** — Cron job picks up yesterday's file
- **Re-prioritize** — AI rewrites the file, app shows the new order
- **Extract patterns** — "You always defer @Health tasks. Want me to schedule them?"
- **Talk to other systems** — Plain text goes anywhere

The app is the input layer. Your AI is the brain.

**MinisList stays dumb so your stack can be smart.**

## Section 4: How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Capture   │ ──▶ │    Sync     │ ──▶ │  AI Magic   │
│  (Phone)    │     │ (iCloud/etc)│     │ (Your stack)│
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

1. **You** jot down tasks throughout the day
2. **MinisList** saves them as `2026-01-31.md`
3. **Your system** (Obsidian, Claude, scripts, whatever) processes them
4. **Tomorrow** you open a fresh file

One file per day. Check things off. Move on.

---

## Section 5: The Format

Simple but powerful. Add as much or as little detail as you want:

```markdown
- [ ] Simple task

- [ ] Task with context @Project #tag !priority

- [ ] Full details @Work #urgent !high +Boss ~30min &Career
  Notes: Include Q4 projections
  They need this before the board meeting
```

**Six optional symbols** — define what they mean for your workflow:

| Symbol | You decide |
|--------|------------|
| `@` | Project, client, area |
| `#` | Tag, label, category |
| `!` | Priority, energy, mood |
| `+` | Person, context, place |
| `~` | Time, estimate, size |
| `&` | Goal, theme, quarter |

Configure what shows on the list vs. detail view.

## Section 6: Works With Everything

**Because it's just text files:**

- 📁 **iCloud Drive** — Sync across devices
- 📝 **Obsidian** — Part of your vault
- 💻 **Cursor / VS Code** — Edit with your code
- 🤖 **Claude / GPT** — AI processes your day
- ⚙️ **Cron jobs** — Automate nightly reviews
- 🔀 **Git** — Version control your tasks
- 🔍 **grep / ripgrep** — Search everything instantly

No API. No export. No migration. Your tasks are already everywhere.

---

## Section 7: What You Get

- **📱 iPhone app** — Fast, native, minimal
- **📄 Plain markdown** — Open format, zero lock-in
- **🔄 Real-time sync** — iCloud, Dropbox, or local
- **📅 One file per day** — Clean separation
- **🔒 Read-only mode** — Lock processed days
- **⚡ Offline-first** — Works without connection

**What you don't get:**
- ❌ AI suggestions
- ❌ Smart scheduling
- ❌ Calendar integration
- ❌ Team collaboration
- ❌ Notifications
- ❌ Any "intelligence" whatsoever

That's your job. Or your AI's job.

---

## Section 8: Who It's For

**MinisList is for you if:**

- You have an AI assistant (Claude, GPT, local LLM)
- You use Obsidian or plain-text workflows
- You're tired of todo apps that think they're smarter than you
- You want to build automations on top of your tasks
- You believe in open formats and data ownership

**MinisList is NOT for you if:**

- You want the app to tell you what to do
- You need team features
- You want integrations out of the box
- You prefer pretty over functional

---

## Section 9: Pricing

**Free** — forever, for the basic app

**$9 one-time** — unlock:
- Custom sync locations
- Multiple symbol configs
- Export/backup tools
- Support development

No subscription. No cloud account. You own everything.

# Social/Launch Copy

## Tweet thread

**1/** I built the dumbest todo app.

No AI. No smart features. No integrations. Just checkboxes and a text file.

Here's why that's the smartest thing I could do 🧵

**2/** Every todo app wants to be your brain.

Auto-scheduling. Smart suggestions. "Let us organize your day."

But then my AI assistant couldn't read any of my tasks. They were trapped in a proprietary database.

**3/** So I built MinisList.

You add tasks. You check them off. That's it.

Tasks save as plain markdown:

```
- [ ] Call dentist @Health
- [x] Buy coffee
```

**4/** Now my AI can:
- Read my tasks
- Process them overnight  
- Re-prioritize my day
- Extract patterns across weeks
- Actually help me

**5/** The app is intentionally dumb.

Because your AI is smart.
Your Obsidian plugins are smart.
Your cron jobs are smart.

MinisList is just the input layer.

**6/** Launching soon.

Plain text. Markdown files. One per day. Syncs to iCloud.

The dumb todo list for your smart AI.

## HN Post

**Title:** MinisList – The dumb todo list for your smart AI

**Text:**

I kept running into the same problem: my AI assistant (Claude) couldn't help with my todo list because all my tasks were locked in Todoist's database.

So I built the dumbest possible todo app:
- Add tasks
- Check them off
- Saves as markdown files

That's it. No AI, no smart features, no integrations.

Now I have a simple iPhone app for capture, and my AI processes the plain text files overnight. It re-prioritizes, extracts patterns, and actually helps me plan.

The app is the input layer. Your AI is the brain.

Looking for beta testers who use AI assistants + plain text workflows.
