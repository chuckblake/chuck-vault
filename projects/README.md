# Projects

Active, time-bound work with clear end states. These are things you're working toward completing.

## Active Projects

| Project | Area | Status | Target Date |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| | | | |

## vs Areas

**Projects** = Has an end date, you complete it
**Areas** = Ongoing, you maintain it

## Project Template

Create a folder for significant projects:

```
projects/
└── project-name/
    ├── README.md      # Overview, goals, status
    ├── notes.md       # Working notes
    └── ...            # Other relevant files
```

Or a single file for smaller projects:

```markdown
# Project Name

**Status:** Active / On Hold / Completed
**Target Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Area:** Work / Venture / Personal

## Goal
What does "done" look like?

## Next Actions
- [ ] Action 1
- [ ] Action 2

## Notes
Working notes, decisions, progress updates.
```

## Lifecycle

1. **Start:** Create project file/folder, define "done"
2. **Work:** Update regularly, track progress
3. **Complete:** Mark done, capture learnings
4. **Archive:** Move to `archive/projects/`

## Tips

- Keep the list short - if everything is a project, nothing is
- Define "done" clearly upfront
- Review active projects in weekly review
- Move completed projects to archive promptly
