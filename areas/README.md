# Areas

Ongoing responsibilities and life domains. These don't have end dates - they're things you maintain.

## Structure

| Area | What It Contains |
|------|------------------|
| `work/` | LEA Technologies - CTO role, team, technical leadership |
| `ventures/` | Side projects - GetMusic.fm, Indie Crates, ideas |
| `personal/` | Health, relationships, finances, life stuff |

## vs Projects

**Areas** = Ongoing responsibilities (maintain)
**Projects** = Time-bound work with end dates (complete)

Examples:
- "Health" is an **area** (ongoing)
- "Run a marathon" is a **project** (has an end)
- "Team management" is an **area** (ongoing)
- "Hire first engineer" is a **project** (has an end)

## What Goes Here

- Reference information you need regularly
- Templates specific to that area
- Logs and notes related to the area
- Current state documentation

## Maintenance

Review during weekly/monthly reviews:
- Is anything stale?
- Are the right things captured?
- Should anything move to archive?
