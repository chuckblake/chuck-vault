# About Chuck

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Who I Am

I'm Chuck Blake — CTO and co-founder of LEA Technologies by day, tinkerer and builder of side projects by night. I've got early-stage startup DNA and a bias toward action. I've worked across engineering, product, marketing, and operations, always focused on using modern tools to get ideas into the world faster.

## Professional Life

**Current Role:** CTO & Co-Founder at LEA Technologies
- Building document intelligence and workflow automation for wealth management
- Leading a small, high-leverage engineering team (3 people including myself)
- Series A target Q2-Q3 2026

**What LEA Does:** We help wealth management firms extract structured data from complex financial documents and automate critical workflows. We're invisible infrastructure - we plug into Salesforce, Egnyte, M365, and Snowflake, then disappear.

## Creative Ventures
