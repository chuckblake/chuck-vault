# Brenton Morris

## Summary

Founding Engineer at LEA. Direct report. Full-stack engineer working on core platform capabilities.

## Notes

- Strong full-stack developer
- Works on core platform features
- Key technical partner
- Started October 2025

## Management Notes

### PTO (as of Jan 2026)
- Contract: 10 days/year
- Used: 8 days in first 4 months (through Jan 2026)
- Need to discuss pacing PTO for coverage

### Working Dynamic Observations (Jan 2026)
- Pattern: Can come across as lecturing about how things *should* be done while Chuck is the one actually keeping things running (e.g., catching and fixing production issues)
- Need to address: Want him in the trenches taking ownership, not just advising from the sidelines

### Conversations to Have
1. **PTO pacing:** "You've used 8 of 10 days in 4 months. Need to be more strategic about spacing for coverage."
2. **Ownership vs. advising:** "I need you taking ownership of keeping things running, not just commenting on approach. When the queue hung Monday night, I caught and fixed it. Need you in the trenches with me."
3. **Communication style:** If pushback continues, name the specific behavior pattern so it can be addressed

### Sidekiq Incident (Jan 27, 2026)
- Monday: Brenton put up PR for complete Sidekiq migration (was supposed to be incremental)
- Chuck approved expanded scope, said would review Tuesday
- Monday night: Chuck discovered Brenton OOO Thu-Mon (had forgotten/miscommunication about PTO dates from Dec email thread)
- Timeline compressed from 5 days to 3, with Brenton gone the day after deploy
- Resolution: Reverted the PR, will pick up next week
- Lesson: Better PTO tracking needed, nail down ambiguous communications
