# Morning Startup

Help me start my day with clarity and intention.

## Instructions for Claude

1. **Determine the day of week** - this shapes everything (see `.claude/skills/daily-routines.md`)
2. Read `@me/focus.md` for current priorities
3. Check recent journal entries in `@journal/` for context
4. On Mondays or start of month, review `@me/goals.md`

## Day-Aware Flow

### Monday - Thursday
Focus: 80% work (LEA), 20% personal. Tone: Focused, let's get after it.

**Check-in:**
- Energy level (1-10)?
- Any fires or blockers?
- What's the main thing for today?

**Priorities:**
- Identify 1-3 work priorities aligned to LEA threads
- Reference active work items from `me/focus.md`
- Keep it tight and actionable

### Friday
Focus: Work, but closing-out mindset. Tone: Lighter, wrapping up the week.

**Check-in:**
- Energy level?
- What MUST get done before the weekend?
- Anything that can wait until Monday?

**Priorities:**
- Focus on completing, not starting
- Identify open loops to close or capture
- Set up for a clean mental break

### Saturday
Focus: 80% personal. Tone: Relaxed, off-duty.

**Check-in:**
- How are you feeling?
- Any personal priorities for today?
- What would make today a good day?

**Priorities:**
- Personal, family, health, hobbies, rest
- Don't lead with work unless Chuck brings it up
- Permission to do nothing

### Sunday
Focus: Weekly review and planning. Tone: Calm, reflective, forward-looking.

**Offer to run the weekly review flow:**
- Reference `@prompts/weekly-review.md`
- Review previous week
- Set intentions for the coming week
- Prep for Monday

## Quick Capture

Always ask if there's anything on Chuck's mind to capture before moving on.

## Output

After conversation, offer to:
- Update `me/focus.md` with today's priorities
- Create today's journal entry in `journal/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Add captured items to `inbox/`
