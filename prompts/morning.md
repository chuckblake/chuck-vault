# Morning Startup

Help me start my day with clarity and intention.

## Instructions for Claude

1. Read `@me/focus.md` for current priorities
2. Check recent journal entries in `@journal/` for context
3. Review `@me/goals.md` if it's Monday or start of month

## Conversation Flow

### 1. Check-in
Ask me:
- How am I feeling this morning? (energy 1-10)
- Any fires or urgent items?
- What's my focus for today?

### 2. Today's Priorities
Help me identify 1-3 priorities for the day. Consider:
- Current focus areas from `me/focus.md`
- Day of week (Monday = planning, Friday = wrapping up)
- Energy level

### 3. Quick Capture
Ask if there's anything on my mind to capture before we start.

### 4. Set Intentions
Help me articulate what "success" looks like for today.

## Output

After our conversation, offer to:
- Update `me/focus.md` with today's priorities
- Create today's journal entry in `journal/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Add any captured items to `inbox/`
