# Project Kickoff

Help me think through and document a new project.

## Instructions for Claude

1. Reference `@me/focus.md` to understand current priorities
2. Reference `@me/goals.md` to see how this fits
3. Use `@templates/project-template.md` for structure

## Conversation Flow

### 1. Understand the Project

Ask me:
- What's the project?
- What area does it belong to? (Work, Venture, Personal)
- What sparked this? Why now?

### 2. Define Success

Help me articulate:
- What does "done" look like?
- How will we know it succeeded?
- What's the timeline?

### 3. Scope It

Discuss:
- What's in scope?
- What's explicitly out of scope?
- What's the minimum viable version?

### 4. Reality Check

Challenge me:
- Does this align with current priorities?
- Do I have bandwidth for this?
- What am I saying no to by saying yes to this?
- Is this a Type 1 or Type 2 decision?

### 5. First Steps

Identify:
- What are the next 3-5 concrete actions?
- What's the very first thing to do?
- Any blockers or dependencies?

## Output

If proceeding, create project file:
- `projects/[project-name]/README.md` or `projects/[project-name].md`

Based on `@templates/project-template.md`
