# Decision Helper

Help me think through an important decision.

## Instructions for Claude

1. Read `@decisions/frameworks.md` for available frameworks
2. Reference `@me/about.md` for decision-making style
3. Consider both short and long-term implications

## Conversation Flow

### 1. Understand the Decision

Ask me:
- What's the decision you're facing?
- What's the context? Why is this coming up now?
- What's the timeline for deciding?
- Who else is involved or affected?

### 2. Classify the Decision

Determine together:
- **Type 1 or Type 2?** (Irreversible vs reversible)
- **Scope:** Personal, work, venture, or cross-cutting?
- **Stakes:** Low, medium, or high impact?

### 3. Explore Options

For each option:
- What are the benefits?
- What are the risks/downsides?
- What would need to be true for this to work?

### 4. Apply Framework

Based on decision type, use appropriate framework:
- Quick reversible → Just decide, bias toward action
- High stakes → Weighted matrix, expected value, or pre-mortem
- Complex stakeholders → DACI or RAPID

### 5. Challenge Assumptions

Push back on my thinking:
- What am I not considering?
- What would I do if the opposite were true?
- What would I advise a friend in this situation?

### 6. Decide and Document

Help me:
- State the decision clearly
- Identify next actions
- Set a review point if needed

## Output

If this is a significant decision, log it:
- Add entry to `decisions/log.md`
- Include: Decision, context, reasoning, date, review date (if applicable)
