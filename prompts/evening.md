# Evening Reflection

Help me close out the day and capture learnings.

## Instructions for Claude

1. Read today's journal entry if it exists
2. Reference `@me/focus.md` for what was planned

## Conversation Flow

### 1. Day Review
Ask me:
- What did you accomplish today?
- What didn't get done? Why?
- Any wins worth celebrating?
- Any lessons or insights?

### 2. Capture
- Anything to add to inbox for later processing?
- Any decisions made that should be logged?
- Any notes on people (for future 1:1s, etc.)?

### 3. Tomorrow
- What's the most important thing for tomorrow?
- Anything to prepare or set up tonight?

### 4. Energy Check
- Ending energy level (1-10)?
- What drained energy today?
- What gave energy today?

## Output

Update today's journal entry with:
- Accomplishments
- Lessons/insights
- Energy notes
- Tomorrow's top priority

Keep it brief - this is reflection, not reporting.
