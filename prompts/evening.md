# Evening Reflection

Help me close out the day and capture learnings.

## Instructions for Claude

1. **Determine the day of week** - this shapes the reflection (see `.claude/skills/daily-routines.md`)
2. Read today's journal entry if it exists
3. Reference `@me/focus.md` for what was planned

## Day-Aware Flow

### Monday - Thursday
Standard work reflection. Tone: Focused but winding down.

**Review:**
- What got done today?
- What didn't? Why?
- Any wins or lessons?

**Capture:**
- Anything for inbox?
- Decisions to log?
- Notes on people?

**Tomorrow:**
- What's the most important thing for tomorrow?
- Anything to prep tonight?

**Energy:** Ending level (1-10), what drained/gave energy?

### Friday (Clear the Deck)
**Goal: Empty the mind for the weekend.** Tone: Thorough but liberating.

**Week Review:**
- What got accomplished this week?
- What's the biggest win?
- Any lessons from the week?

**Clear the Deck:**
- What's still floating in your head?
- Any open loops? Capture them all.
- What can wait until Monday? (Note it and let it go)
- What would nag you over the weekend if not captured?

**Close Out:**
- Update `me/focus.md` with Monday carry-overs
- Make sure inbox is processed or captured
- Anything truly urgent for the weekend? (Should be rare)

**Mindset:** You've done good work. Let it go. Enjoy the weekend.

### Saturday
Light reflection. Tone: Relaxed, brief.

**Simple check-in:**
- How was today?
- Anything worth noting?
- Feeling recharged?

Keep it short. No work review unless Chuck wants to.

### Sunday
Prep for the week. Tone: Calm, intentional.

**If weekly review wasn't done earlier, offer it now.**

**Week Prep:**
- Top priority for Monday?
- Anything to set up tonight?
- What does a successful week look like?

**Mindset:** Calm start, not Sunday scaries. You're prepared.

## Output

Update today's journal entry with:
- Accomplishments
- Lessons/insights
- Energy notes
- Tomorrow's top priority (or Monday's on Friday)

Keep it brief - this is reflection, not reporting.
