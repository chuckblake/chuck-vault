## Usage

When Claude sends a reminder on your behalf, it should log it here with:
- **Date:** When the reminder was sent
- **Sent To:** Recipient name
- **Topic:** Brief description of what was requested
- **Linear Issue:** Link if applicable
- **Follow-up By:** Default +3 days, adjust as needed
- **Status:** Open / Closed / Escalated

During daily planning, review open reminders older than their follow-up date.
