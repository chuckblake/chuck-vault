## Preparation Framework

### Before the Conversation

1. **Clarify your intent**
   - What outcome do you want?
   - What do you want them to understand?
   - What do you want to understand from them?

2. **Gather facts**
   - Specific examples
   - Data points
   - Timeline of events

3. **Consider their perspective**
   - How might they see this?
   - What are they likely feeling?
   - What might they need from this conversation?

4. **Plan the logistics**
   - Private setting
   - Enough time
   - Right timing (not Friday EOD, not before vacation)

## Saying No

### Script Templates

**No to a feature request:**
"We won't be able to prioritize this for Q2. Here's why: [context]. What I can do is [alternative]."

**No to a timeline:**
"We can't deliver all of this by [date]. We could deliver [subset] by then, or [full scope] by [later date]. Which works better for your needs?"

**No to a resource request:**
"I don't have headcount to give you right now. Let me help you think through how to achieve your goals with current resources, or let's discuss what would need to change for this to be possible."

## Conflict Resolution

### Structure
1. Meet individually first
2. Understand each perspective
3. Find common ground
4. Facilitate joint conversation
5. Agree on path forward
6. Follow up

### Facilitation Script

"We're here to resolve [issue]. I'd like each of you to share your perspective without interruption. Then we'll work together on a solution. [Name], would you start?"

(After both share)

"What I'm hearing is [summary]. Where do you agree? What do you both want?"

## General Principles

1. **Be direct** - Ambiguity is unkind
2. **Be specific** - Examples matter
3. **Listen more than talk** - Their perspective matters
4. **Assume good intent** - Until proven otherwise
5. **Focus on future** - What changes, not rehashing past
6. **Follow up** - Don't let it end in the room
7. **Document** - Protect everyone
