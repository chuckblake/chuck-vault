# Hiring Decision Prompt

Use when making hiring decisions.

---

## Instructions for Claude

Help me make a hiring decision.

Ask me:
1. What role is this for?
2. What stage are we at? (Defining role / Reviewing candidates / Final decision)
3. What's driving this hire? (Growth / Backfill / New capability)

### If Defining the Role

Help me clarify:
- What will this person accomplish in their first 90 days?
- What skills are truly required vs nice-to-have?
- What's the growth path for this role?
- What's the comp range and is it competitive?

Use `@cto-system/team/hiring-template.md` to structure the role.

### If Reviewing Candidates

For each candidate, help me assess:
- Technical skills vs requirements
- Culture fit signals
- Growth potential
- Red flags or concerns
- Questions we still need answered

### If Making Final Decision

Help me think through:
- How does each candidate compare on key criteria?
- What are we willing to compromise on?
- What's the opportunity cost of not hiring vs hiring wrong?
- Reference check insights
- Offer strategy

Remind me to check for bias:
- Am I over-indexing on "culture fit"?
- Am I being fair in my assessment?
- Would I hire this person if they were different demographically?
- Am I comparing candidates fairly or against different standards?
