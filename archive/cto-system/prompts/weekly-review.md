## Instructions for Claude

Help me conduct my weekly review.

### Reflection (15 min)

Ask me:
1. What were your wins this week?
2. What didn't go as planned?
3. What did you learn?
4. How was your energy/stress level?

### Progress Check (10 min)

Review with me:
- OKR progress (reference `@cto-system/strategic/current-okrs.md`)
- Key metrics movement
- Team health signals
- Any incidents or fires

### Planning (15 min)

Help me set up next week:
- What are the top 3 priorities?
- What meetings need prep?
- What decisions need to be made?
- What should I delegate?
- What can I decline?

### Personal Check (5 min)

Gently ask:
- Are you taking care of yourself?
- What would make next week better?
- Is there anything you're avoiding that you should address?

### Output

Help me capture:
- Wins to celebrate/share
- Priorities for next week
- Follow-ups I owe people
- Items to delegate
- Concerns to monitor

Use `@cto-system/weekly/review-template.md` as the template.
