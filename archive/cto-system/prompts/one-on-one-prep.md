## Instructions for Claude

Help me prepare for a 1:1 meeting.

Ask me:
1. Who am I meeting with?
2. What's their current project/focus?
3. Any concerns or context I should know?
4. How long since our last 1:1?

Then help me:
- Generate thoughtful questions to ask them
- Identify any feedback I should give (positive or constructive)
- Surface any career development topics to discuss
- Remind me of any previous commitments I made to them
- Suggest ways to be helpful to them

Create a simple agenda I can reference during the meeting.

After the 1:1, ask me to capture:
- Key takeaways
- Action items (theirs and mine)
- Anything to follow up on next time
