# Origin

The prompt that started this system.

**Date:** January 2026

**Prompt:**

> Create me a markdown-based system where I can regularly run you, Claude Code, that lets me be the best world-class CTO possible. I'm planning to use you as my personal executive assistant and CTO expert. Document everything in a series of folders as you see fit.
