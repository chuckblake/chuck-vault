# Inbox

Quick capture for anything. Don't overthink - just throw it in.

## What Goes Here

- Quick thoughts and ideas
- Links to read later
- Notes from conversations
- Random captures
- Anything you don't know where to put

## How to Use

### Adding Items

Just create a file or ask Claude:
- `claude "Add to inbox: [thought]"`
- Create `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` for longer captures

### Processing (Weekly)

During weekly review, process each item:
- **Delete:** No longer relevant
- **Do:** Takes < 2 minutes, just do it
- **Delegate:** Someone else should handle
- **Defer:** Schedule for later
- **File:** Move to appropriate location (areas/, knowledge/, projects/)

## File Naming

- `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md` for dated items
- `topic.md` for quick notes
- Don't stress about names - it's temporary

## Tips

- Lower friction = more capture = better system
- Bad capture > no capture
- Process regularly so it doesn't pile up
