# Meeting: LEA Strategy Call with Matt Ober - 2026-01-26

## Summary

Strategy call with Matt Ober (Social Leverage investor) covering Egnyte go-to-market strategy, the Mission Wealth M&A use case, and various portfolio connections. Matt strongly encouraged pursuing the M&A use case even if it feels like services work - land and expand is the right strategy.

## Key Points

### Egnyte Go-To-Market
- Have extremely positive feedback from firms using Egnyte webhooks
- Now have list of ~120 Egnyte customers that are RIAs/broker dealers
- Outreach strategies: cold email, phone calls, LinkedIn mutual connections, Egnyte account manager intros
- **LinkedIn ads** - Matt heard from Steph at Portage that hyper-targeted LinkedIn ads work well when you know exact companies
- T3 conference - pitched Egnyte on joint dinner/happy hour (co-sponsored)
- Should make Egnyte account managers "best friends" - offer joint drinks/dinners in their regions

### Mission Wealth M&A Use Case
- After acquisitions, need to identify 4 specific documents per household for compliance
- Current product priced for "process everything" not "needle in haystack"
- **Matt's advice:** Do the work. Get deeper with clients. Figure out how to productize later.
- Goal: go from $10k → $30k → $80k per client across 5 use cases
- "Saying no to this revenue seems dumb" - it's still document intelligence, just different pricing model
- M&A integration is a huge opportunity - every RIA is acquiring right now

### Healthcare Vertical
- Jared from New Tech pushing hard to license tool for healthcare use case
- Matt advised against it - distraction from core focus
- Could be part of Series A story ("interest from other verticals, not pursuing")
- "You can build a billion dollar company just sticking to wealth"

## Decisions

- Pursue Mission Wealth M&A use case even though it's more services-oriented
- Start LinkedIn ads campaign targeting the 120 Egnyte customer domains
- Ask Egnyte for 3-4 strategic intros (not 150)
- Don't pursue healthcare vertical now

## Action Items

- [ ] @Max: Text Howard - coffee/lunch next week when he's in town (give him latest so he can speak to wealth managers)
- [ ] @Max: Send Matt a note about M&A integration work for Brent (Full Circle → Wealth Enhancement)
- [ ] @Max: Work on LinkedIn ads targeting Egnyte customer list
- [ ] @Max: Ask Egnyte for 3-4 strategic intros (Carson, Lido, Wealthspire, Apollon)
- [ ] @Matt: Check notes for LinkedIn ads contacts/advice
- [ ] @Matt: Update on Rothschild/Social Leverage Wealth within 2-3 weeks
- [ ] April: Golf outing in San Diego with EP Wealth contacts (via Nick from Opto)

## Company/Contact Notes

**Target Companies on Egnyte List:**
- Carson Wealth - huge, want intro
- Lido - been trying, no luck
- Wealthspire - management change, been trying
- SCS (part of Focus) - Powder working with them
- Apollon - Max already in touch
- Pure, and many smaller ones

**Portfolio Connections:**
- **Wealth Enhancement Group** ($140B) - acquiring Full Circle Wealth. Brent is LP at Full Circle. Max to send note for intro.
- **EP Wealth** - is an LP (via OAP Dove). Nick from Opto knows everyone there. Plan golf outing in April (San Diego).
- **Rothschild** - Max talked to James (family friend). They hired F2 consultant. Matt in deep discussions with Sean Kelly (chairman) about Social Leverage Wealth partnership - could be opportunity.
- **Cress** - potential close, bigger than most on Egnyte list
