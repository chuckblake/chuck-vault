## Notes

**Ben's Background:**
- Worked at Meta on AI assistant team for smart glasses
- Focused on infrastructure around models
- Experienced the limitations of AI and challenges building AI products

**Ben's New Company:**
- Building scalable methods to monitor, evaluate, and optimize agent performance
- Uses concept of "traces" to visualize agent actions for a single task
- Derives metrics like recall and precision at task-level and subquery-level
- Can create natural language tasks based on document type to help AI formulate requirements
- Platform built in December, has early beta users testing it

**LEA's Current Setup:**
- Uses Reducto for document extraction
- Webhook system recently added, working well
- Example value prop: client avoided hiring 2 FTEs for document renaming/extraction

**Potential Synergies:**
- Ben's monitoring could help validate LEA's document extraction quality
- Natural language task approach could improve document validation
- Could provide "intelligent way to validate documents and identify issues quickly"
