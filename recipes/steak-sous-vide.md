# Steak Sous Vide

Perfect medium-rare steak every time.

## Method

1. Season steak with salt and pepper
2. Vacuum seal or use water displacement method with zip-lock bag
3. Cook at **132°F (55.5°C)** for 1-2 hours
4. Remove from bag and pat dry
5. Sear in a ripping hot cast iron pan (1 min per side)
6. Rest briefly and serve

## Notes

- 132°F gives a perfect medium-rare
- Longer cook times (up to 4 hours) won't overcook, just makes it more tender
- Make sure to dry the steak thoroughly before searing for best crust
