# Korean Wing Sauce

Sweet, spicy, and savory gochujang-based wing sauce.

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon roughly chopped garlic
- 1 tablespoon roughly chopped ginger
- 3 tablespoons gochujang (adjust to taste)
- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 3 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 6 tablespoons honey

## Instructions

1. Heat sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat
2. Sauté garlic and ginger until fragrant (1-2 min)
3. Add gochujang, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and honey
4. Stir to combine and simmer for 2-3 minutes
5. Toss with crispy fried or baked wings

## Notes

- Gochujang heat varies by brand - start with less if unsure
- Sauce thickens as it cools
- Great on fried chicken, grilled meat, or as a dipping sauce
