- 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup oats
- 4 dates, pitted
- 4 scoops protein powder
- 1/4 cup cocoa powder
- 1/4 cup sweetener (monk fruit, stevia, etc.)
- Egg whites (to bind)
- Chocolate chips for topping (optional)

## Instructions

2. Add all ingredients except chocolate chips to food processor
3. Blend until smooth and combined
4. Line a bread pan with parchment paper

6. Top with chocolate chips if desired
7. Bake for 40 minutes until set (check center with toothpick)
8. Let cool completely before slicing into bars
