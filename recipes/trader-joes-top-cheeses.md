# Trader Joe's Top 7 Cheeses

Personal favorites from Trader Joe's cheese section.

## The List

1. **Chèvre with Fine Herbs** - Herbed goat cheese
2. **Fromage Pavé** - French-style soft cheese
3. **Goat Smoked Gouda Style** - Smoked goat cheese
4. **Mini Basque** - Small-format sheep's milk cheese
5. **Unexpected Cheddar** - Sharp cheddar with parmesan notes
6. **Thousand Day Gouda** - Aged gouda, crystalline texture *(favorite)*
7. **Blue Stilton** - Classic English blue cheese

## Notes

- Thousand Day Gouda is the standout
- Good cheese board combo: mix soft (Chèvre, Pavé) with hard (Gouda, Cheddar) and blue (Stilton)
