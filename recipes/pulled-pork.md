## Oven Method

1. Rub pork shoulder with mustard, then apply spice rub generously
2. Place on sheet pan with resting rack
3. Preheat oven to **275°F (135°C)**
4. Place a pan of hot water on bottom rack (for moisture)
5. Bake for **6-10 hours** until internal temp reaches **165°F (73°C)**
6. Wrap in butcher's paper
7. Return to oven for **2-3 more hours** until internal temp reaches **205°F (96°C)**
8. Rest for at least **45 minutes** before shredding

## Notes

- Total cook time depends on size of pork shoulder
- Can season pork the night before if time allows
- The water pan prevents the meat from drying out
- Butcher's paper lets it breathe while retaining moisture
