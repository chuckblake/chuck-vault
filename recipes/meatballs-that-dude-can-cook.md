## Meatballs

### Ingredients

- 1.5 lbs 80/20 ground beef
- 1.5 lbs ground pork
- 2 large eggs
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 celery stalks
- 2 carrots
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 1/3 cup Italian parsley, chopped
- 20 leaves fresh basil
- 10 sprigs thyme, stripped

- 1/2 cup Parmigiano Reggiano, finely grated
- 1/2 cup Pecorino Romano
- 6 oz white bread + 1/2 cup whole milk (panade)
- 1 tbsp rosemary salt
- 2 tsp fresh ground black pepper

### Instructions

1. Soak bread in milk to form panade
2. Finely chop onion, celery, carrots, and herbs

4. Mix gently - don't overwork

6. Form into balls (~2-3 oz each)
7. Bake at **425°F** for 15-20 minutes
