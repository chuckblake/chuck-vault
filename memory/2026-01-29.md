## Session with Chuck

### Completed
- Enabled `/restart` command in config
- Installed 1Password CLI at `~/.local/bin/op` (v2.32.0)
- Created 1Password skill at `/Users/gomez/clawd/skills/1password/SKILL.md`
- Set up service account token in `~/.clawdbot/.env` as `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`
- Verified vault access: "Gomez" vault contains Google login for `gomezbot602@gmail.com`

### TODO (pickup tomorrow)
- Gmail setup needs an **App Password** to work with SMTP
- Chuck needs to:
  1. Enable 2FA on gomezbot602@gmail.com (if not already)
  2. Generate App Password at myaccount.google.com → Security → App passwords
  3. Add it to 1Password (as "app_password" field) or share it
- Then: send test email to Chuck Blake (email in contacts)

### Notes
- The `.env` file doesn't auto-load on SIGUSR1 restart — workaround is sourcing it inline in commands
- Chuck's email is under "Chuck Blake" in contacts (need to find it tomorrow)
