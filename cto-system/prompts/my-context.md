# Chuck Blake — CTO, LEA

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## About Me

**Name:** Chuck Blake
**Role:** CTO & Co-Founder
**Company:** LEA
**Reporting To:** N/A (Co-Founder)

I'm the CTO and co-founder of LEA, where I'm rethinking how wealth management firms handle data in the age of AI. I'm a startup executive with early-stage DNA and a bias toward action. I've worked across engineering, product, marketing, and operations—always focused on using modern tools to get ideas into the world faster.

At LEA, my team and I help firms extract structured data from complex financial documents and automate critical workflows, from document organization to pushing clean data into CRMs and planning platforms. I believe the best code is the kind that makes people's jobs easier, not harder.

## Company Context

**Industry:** Wealth Management / FinTech
**Stage:** Seed (Series A target Q2-Q3 2026)
**Company Size:** 4 people
**Engineering Team Size:** 3 (including myself)
**Business Model:** B2B SaaS - Document intelligence and workflow automation

### What We Do

**LEA** provides document intelligence and workflow automation for wealth management. We work directly with leadership teams at growth-oriented RIAs, enterprise wealth management firms, and private market platforms.

Most firms come to us to:
- Extract holdings from brokerage statements
- Classify and organize files automatically
- Accelerate asset transitions

We plug into Salesforce, Egnyte, Microsoft 365, and Snowflake—then disappear. Teams use their existing tools while LEA works behind the scenes.

### Why We're Different

We're building **invisible infrastructure**, not another SaaS tool requiring daily engagement. Our automation-first approach:
- **Zero-touch automation** — auto-ingest, auto-classify, auto-export
- **Wealth management specialization** — we understand RIA workflows and pain points
- **Enterprise-ready** — SOC II Type 2 certified, client data never used for AI training
- **Proven ROI** — we calculate impact from simple business inputs

Leading firms like Farther Finance, Pure Financial, and Mission Wealth trust LEA to power their growth.

### Business Impact

| Use Case | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Prospect Conversion | 3X speed increase, 30% reduction in planning backlogs |
| Client Onboarding | 50% faster account opening, 25% faster investor onboarding |
| Operational Efficiency | 75% reduction in transition time, 40 hours saved per audit |

### Current Company Priorities
1. Compress time-to-value through automation

3. Build foundation for Series A

### Key Challenges
- Scaling a 4-person team to operate like a 20-person team through AI
