## Instructions for Claude

Help me prepare a board/executive update on engineering.

Ask me:
1. What period is this covering?
2. Who's the audience and what do they care most about?
3. What are the 3 most important things they should know?
4. Any sensitive topics to navigate carefully?

Help me create an update that covers:

### Executive Summary
- 3-5 bullet points maximum
- Lead with what matters most to the business
- Bad news first, with context and plan

### Metrics
- Reference my KPIs from `@cto-system/metrics/current-kpis.md`
- Highlight what's on/off track
- Explain variances

### Accomplishments
- Focus on business impact, not technical details
- Translate engineering work to business value

### Challenges & Risks
- Be honest but solution-oriented
- Include mitigation plans

### Team
- Headcount, key hires, departures
- Team health summary

### Looking Ahead
- Key milestones
- What the board should expect

Use `@cto-system/communication/board-update-template.md` as the structure.

Help me avoid:
- Too much technical jargon
- Burying bad news
- Missing the "so what"
- Being too long
