## Instructions for Claude

Read my context from `@cto-system/prompts/my-context.md` and then help me with my morning briefing.

Ask me:
1. How are you feeling today? (Energy level 1-10)
2. Any fires or urgent issues from overnight?
3. What's your #1 priority for today?

Then help me:
- Review my calendar and flag any concerns
- Identify my top 3 priorities
- Surface any blockers I should address
- Remind me of any follow-ups I owe people

Keep it concise and action-oriented. No fluff.

If I mention I'm stressed or overwhelmed, help me triage and identify what can be delegated or deferred.

End by asking if there's anything specific I want to think through together.
